                At some point when I was in high school (2003-2007) I discovered and began using Game Maker.
                I created several terrible things with this program, and might post those some day.
                Out of all of those bad projects though, the worst (or best?) is <i>Super String</i>.
            </p><p>
                In Super String the main character was created by scribbling the mouse in ms paint for about 1 second.
                The goal of this player character is to collect all the red triangles on the screen and avoid... fart clouds.
                These obstacles are generated by enemies, whos sprites are just a few dots, and are real pushovers because all you have to do to defeat them is touch them.
            </p><p>
                You'd think that the clouds would also disappear when they touch you, but no, instead they subtract 1 health for each frame they are colliding with you.
                You'd also think that they would be generated near the enemies that cause them to appear, or at least on a part of the screen not directly where the player is at that moment.
                Wrong again, they spawn randomly at 5 pre-determined points on the screen and you just have to memorize them and stay away from those areas.
            </p><p>
                There's a key that lets you invert the color of the player because I didn't understand the concept of using outlines to make objects fit with any background.
            </p><p>
                This game has no story, but I won't spoil the ending.
            </p><p>
                Anyway if you made a shitty game as a teenager it was probably less embarassing than this.
                If Game Maker could export to flash I think this would at least be worth a turd of the week.

                <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ujFinAj-_zIP12SlnLNSRjL-t6Qp6sBT">Download</a><br/>
                I'd post the source if I still had it, but it's long gone and only this EXE remains.
                Assuming you don't consider playing early 2000s punk rock through your speakers malicious, I promise this program will not (intentionally) blow up your computer.
